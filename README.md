## Airflow Fundamentals

This repository contains my work on **Apache Airflow**, where I am building a solid foundation in workflow orchestration and task automation by following tutorials. Having worked with Airflow in a professional setting, I am now focusing on strengthening my understanding of its core concepts, tools, and best practices, which will further enhance my ability to design and optimise data workflows.

### Key Highlights:
- **DAG Design & Development**: Experience in building and maintaining complex DAGs for automating data workflows and task dependencies.
- **Task Integration**: Added custom tasks and integrated Airflow with various external systems to improve workflow efficiency.
- **Debugging & Optimisation**: Applied troubleshooting techniques to debug and optimise Airflow tasks, ensuring robustness and high performance.
